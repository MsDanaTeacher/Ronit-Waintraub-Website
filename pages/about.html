      <h2>How Did I Get Here?</h2>
      <div class="about-me">
      <p id="about-1">
        I have been an educator in the school system for the past five years. My
        strengths have always been in writing, teaching, and content
        development. I thoroughly enjoy the creative process, whether that means
        writing a poem, singing a song, designing curriculum, or iterating on
        e-learning experiences. I went into education because I wanted to have a
        positive impact on the next generation, and make learning engaging and
        meaningful.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p class="about-2">
        After the pandemic hit, I began to explore the world of digital learning
        and the vast potential it has. I thoroughly enjoyed learning a whole new
        way to teach children, as I explored various edtech platforms and all
        they had to offer. My job allowed me the freedom to teach what I wanted
        to, so I was able to design my own lesson plans, and implement the
        activities that I found useful.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="about-3">
        Once my passion for e-learning grew, I began to research different
        opportunities to expand my interests and skills. I came upon an
        instructional design course taught by a former teacher whose goal was to
        show educators that they already have all the skills necessary to design
        instruction. In that course, I learned what the ADDIE model was, and
        practiced implementing it, as I went through each stage of the design
        process. I created four projects, utilizing tools such as Articulate
        Storyline, Rise, Camtasia, and Canva. I watched videos daily on how to
        upskill, practice adult learning theories, become familiar with Learning
        Management Systems, and so much more.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="about-4">
        With each passing day, I became more and more confident that this was
        the path meant for me. My favorite part of teaching has always been
        creating curriculum and making it scenario-based, differentiated, and
        objective-aligned. I am so thrilled to be diving into the world of
        instructional design and applying my passion to educating adults. I feel
        motivated and inspired to take on a new role as an instructional
        designer, and I am so grateful that you have visited my website today to
        learn more about me and my story!
